Notepad is a Jekyll theme which is very simple, clean and beautiful. This theme is good for any blog.

## Minimal & Responsive Design

Based upon a solid grid and designed with **simplicity and focus on typography** in mind, the entire design follows a clean and minimal design philosophy which is easy on the eyes and doesn’t distract from the most important feature of every website: the content.

**Clear shapes, sharp edges and flat shades** create a contemporary and pleasant overall appearance.

A responsive design concept applied to every aspect of the theme ensures that it adapts seamlessly to a wide variety of devices and screen resolutions.

## Subtle Animations

Smooth and particularly *barely noticeable animations reveal contents in a beautiful way* while scrolling down the page. A feature which is not necessarily required for obvious reasons, but it surely improves the experience a little further.

## Retina Ready

In order to make sure *everything looks crisp on high resolution displays* as well, all images used by the theme itself are **scalable vector graphics (SVG)**.

They may be small in terms of file sizes but can be scaled indefinitely so your website will be able to take advantage of the beauty of those retina displays entirely.

## Clean, Valid HTML5 & CSS3

Clean, optimized, validated & handwritten source code can be taken for granted. **Quality code is just as important as good design** and there’s no room for compromises.

In addition to that, the entire theme has been carefully tested to achieve best possible **cross-browser compatibility** and meet highest requirements and so it works just fine in Internet Explorer 9+, Firefox 4+, Safari 5+, Chrome 14+, Opera 10.6+ as well as on iOS 4+ and Android devices.

## Author Bio & Social Sharing

Optionally add an author bio, social media profile links or dynamically generated sharing buttons to each page via front-matters or leave them out entirely — *it’s really up to you.*

## Disqus Comments

A third-party **comment system powered by Disqus** comes with the theme — just add your username to the config file and you’re ready to let the comments roll in.

## Much More

Those features above are just the tip of the iceberg and there’s much more included.

Things like support for **Google Analytics & Web Fonts**, advanced **pagination** on overview pages, **Twitter Cards & Facebook Open Graph** tags dynamically generated, multiple page types, etc.

**Hope you like it!**
